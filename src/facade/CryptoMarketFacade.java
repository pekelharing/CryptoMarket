/**
 * To buy a cryptucurrency we have to go through the number of different procedures and perform multiple tasks.
 * We need to choose a cryptocurrency, check the prices in different markets, compare the prices,
 * and finally to buy the chosen cryptocurrency.
 * The more complex the needed procedure the more we are prone to make mistakes.
 * In the subsystem package of this project you can find a simplified version of various classes and methods
 * that are needed to perform all these tasks and procedures.
 *
 * ASSIGNMENT: Create a Facade class that simplifies the procedure of buying a cryptocurrenccy for a user.
 * Design the class in such a way that all the complexity of buying a cryptocurrency is taken care of so that
 * a user can simply enter a desired cryptocurrency, the funds he is willing to spend for it and the address
 * of his cryptowallet. The rest should be taken care of by the Facade class.
